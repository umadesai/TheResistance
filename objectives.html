                <h2 class="section-heading">Project Objectives</h2>
                <p>We are a team of four Olin students and one Wellesley student, with an intense dislike for reading resistor values. As such, we built a machine that could read resistances for us. We chose this project because it was a unique and innovative idea that interested each of us, and also incorporated challenging components from each of the mechanical, electrical and computing systems. Our specific goals for our final product were focused on having an integrated system that included: </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>A mechanical system that separates resistors and reliably introduces them to the circuit</li>
                    <li>An electrical component that measures resistance values of a significant range</li>
                    <li>An LCD screen that displays the resistance value to the user</li>
                    <li>(stretch goal) An additional mechanical component that physically sorts the resistor into an appropriate place</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Our Team's Overarching Learning Goals</h2>

                <p>As a team we also had several overarching skills that we wanted to learn or further develop while working with The Resistance:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Improving our ability to document our work effectively</li>
                    <li>Learning to integrate different systems efficiently</li>
                    <li>Effectively managing a long term project and ultimately being able to produce a robust final product</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Individual Learning Goals</h2>

                <p>And finally, we each had individual skills that we wanted to focus on while building The Revolution.</p>

                    <li><b>Anna Buchele: Circuit Design, Electrical Prototyping, Mechanical Design</b></li>
                    <p>My main learning goal for this project was to gain experience in the integration of mechanical, software, and electrical systems. I was also interested in electrical prototyping and circuit design, and mechanical design. However, due to the requirements of our electrical system, I ended up focusing mostly on electrical prototyping and circuit design, as well as electrical and software integration. During this project, I developed skills in Arduino programming to control complex electrical systems, and learned how to use unfamiliar electrical components such as the relays and the digital potentiometers. I learned how to surface mount very small components and work with complicated circuits. I also learned the importance of good electrical practices (such as always disconnecting power when the circuit is not in use, and when making adjustments to the circuit). I also learned about the importance of constant integration: by integrating each system as we developed it, we avoided large integration issues at the end of the project. I learned about the importance of communication with team members, as well as the importance of setting small, clearly defined goals. This course as a whole has allowed me to gain experience in some aspects of engineering in which I was lacking, which moves me towards my goal of being a well-rounded engineer. </p>

                    <li><b>Uma Desai: Microcontroller Interfacing, Web Dev, Systems Integration</b></li>
                    <p>My biggest learning goals for this project were to gain experience working with different systems and understanding how to integrate them. Over the course of this project, I have developed skills in this area by programming in Arduino to control motors and servos, helping with fabrication and assembly of the mechanical system, and integrating electrical components into the machine. By working on the website and updating documentation weekly, I have realized the clear advantages to recording work effectively and routinely. This project has also taught me the value of modular design, as we became more effective each sprint at integrating our systems thanks to our easily interchangeable components. And of course I also learned about the importance of team communication and how clear, frequent communication can save significant time and energy. Overall, I have learned a lot over the course of this project about several systems, and it has helped me become a more resourceful engineer.</p>
